   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Cloud and DevOps Learning
=========================
This is my initial (and growing) page of online links and sources to DevOps and Cloud related links, tutorials and tools. As a note, many of the tips and toolsets which I may show will lean more towards the cyber aspect.

Please note that this is still a work in progress. Notify me for any links that go 404 or have typos.

BTW - Because this is freely hosted there is no copyrighted material here.

Topics of Coverage
==================
The following topics are what I'm posting here initially. I'll create more links and pages as I have time:

* :ref:`AWS`
* :ref:`Chef <Chef>`
* :ref:`Docker`
* :ref:`Git <Git>`
* :ref:`Python <Python>`
* :ref:`Jenkins <Jenkins>`
* :ref:`Openshift <Openshift>`
* Splunk (in the works)


Building These Pages (RTD)
==========================
I used the Sphinx python document generator to build these pages and readthedocs.org as a free hosting provider. Yes, there is the annoying little side ad but so far that's all you have to deal with.

Although this resource isn't meant to focus on the structure of this site I've included a few links to below in case you are curious in contributing here or starting your own page:

* `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_ is the python document generator for creating pages in reStructuredText. It also comes with an autobuild mode which runs a background web server that you can immediately process and see your changes in HTML.
* `Sphinx CheatSheet on reStructuredText (reST) <https://thomas-cokelaer.info/tutorials/sphinx/rest_syntax.html>`_
* `Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_ (RTD) integrates with Github and uses Sphinx as a source for coding your documents.
* I like to use `atom <http://atom.io>`_ as an editor. It's feature rich and has a built-in interpreter that mimics Jupyter notebooks for highlighting and running sections of code within the editor to look at your output.

PS - if you are more familiar with Markdown as opposed to Sphinx readthedocs will support conversion from that format as well.
